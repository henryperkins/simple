## Search Feature Logic
The search feature in the generated documentation allows users to quickly find relevant information within the documentation. The search logic works as follows:

1. **Indexing**: During the documentation generation process, a search index is created. This index contains metadata about classes, functions, and constants, including their names, descriptions, and other relevant information.

2. **Search Input**: The generated documentation includes a search bar where users can enter their search queries.

3. **Search Execution**: When a user enters a query and initiates a search, the search logic scans the search index for matches. It looks for occurrences of the query in the names, descriptions, and other metadata fields.

4. **Results Display**: The search results are displayed to the user, highlighting the relevant sections of the documentation that match the query.

This search feature enhances the usability of the documentation by making it easier for users to locate specific information quickly.
