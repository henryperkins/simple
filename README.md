# Simple Extract

## Overview
Simple Extract is a Python-based project designed to simplify the extraction of data from various sources. The project aims to provide an easy-to-use interface and robust functionality for data extraction tasks.

## Features
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with various data sources.
- **Robust Functionality**: Provides reliable and efficient data extraction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.

## Installation
To get started with Simple Extract, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/henryperkins/simple.git
cd simple
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Here is a basic example of how to use Simple Extract:

```python
from simple_extract import Extractor

# Initialize the extractor
extractor = Extractor(source='data_source')

# Perform extraction
data = extractor.extract_code()

# Process the extracted data
print(data)
```

### Structured Outputs
Simple Extract uses structured outputs to validate AI responses against predefined JSON schemas. This ensures reliable and predictable outputs for documentation generation.

#### Example JSON Schema
```json
{
    "summary": "A brief summary of what the code does",
    "description": "A detailed description of the functionality",
    "args": [
        {
            "name": "argument_name",
            "type": "argument_type",
            "description": "argument description"
        }
    ],
    "returns": {
        "type": "return_type",
        "description": "description of the return value"
    },
    "raises": [
        {
            "exception": "exception_type",
            "description": "when this exception is raised"
        }
    ],
    "complexity": 1
}
```

#### Example Usage with Structured Outputs
```python
from simple_extract import Extractor

# Initialize the extractor
extractor = Extractor(source='data_source')

# Perform extraction with structured outputs
data = extractor.extract_code()

# Validate the response against the schema
if extractor.validate(data):
    print("Valid response:", data)
else:
    print("Invalid response:", data)
```
